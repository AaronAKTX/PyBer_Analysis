# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis
This goal of this analysis was to summarize and illustrate how specific pieces of ride-sharting data compare between different city types. The summary includes the number of drivers, the sum of fares for a given period of time, and the average fare in US dollars per ride, all grouped by the city type. The three city types that were used in this analysis are Urban, Suburban, and Rural.

## Resources
- Data Source: PyBer_ride_data.csv, city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.62.0

## Summarized Results
### Rides per City and Average Fare per Ride
The analysis shows that the most rides per city are taken in Urban cities. Suburban cities have fewer rides than urban cities, and rural cities have by far the least amount of rides. The scatterplot below. Fig. 1,  clearly illustrates this. It is also clear that the average price per ride is higher in rural areas, than suburban areas, and urban areas average the lowest cost per ride.

### Totals and Averages
The most rides taken were in Urban cities as are the most drivers, and the greatest sum of fares in the measured time period. The average fare per ride was inversely proportaional, with rural rides costing the most per ride. A notable piece of data that came out of the analysis is the rides per driver. In urban cities, there were actually fewer rides in the measured time than the total number of drivers listed in the urban cities. There are much fewer rides in rural areas, but the fares are greater per ride and there are far fewer drivers, so, on average, the drivers make more in rural areas than in Suburban or Urban areas. Please see the summarized view below.

## District Analysis Summary
Looking at the data, it seems that the most drivers are needed in all city types in the third week of February. Not sure why the highest fares are collected then but it seems to    be a trend worth noting. There is also a very high fare per driver rate in rural areas and an equally low fare per driver in urban areas. Convincing some urban drivers to       drive in rural areas may balance that out. Raising the price of urban city rides by a small percentage would yield a large return and is a recommended strategy.
Here is the chart of Total Fares By City Type from January through April 2019.
